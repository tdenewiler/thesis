\chapter{Controls}
\label{ch:controls}
*** Talk about Lyapunov and PID controllers. ***

\section{PID}
*** Talk about how PID controllers work. Discuss the difficlties of tuning the PID controllers. ***

\section{Lyapunov}
*** Talk about how Lyapunov controllers work \cite{Khalil02}. Show which control Lyapunov function I chose \cite{Rusu05RobotuxLyapunov}. For a given path show the linear and angular velocities that are output by each controller. ***

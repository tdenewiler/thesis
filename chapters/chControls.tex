\chapter{Controls}
\label{ch:controls}
*** Talk about Lyapunov and PID controllers. Discuss the general role that controllers play in autonomous navigation. ***

\section{PID}
\label{sec:pid}
*** Talk about how PID controllers work. Discuss the difficlties of tuning the PID controllers especially when there are hardware changes such as swapping out actuators and changing the center of mass of the robots. These difficulties are further increased when trying to tune the PID controllers to operate at varying velocities. ***

\section{Lyapunov}
\label{sec:lyapunov}
*** Talk about how Lyapunov controllers work \cite{Khalil02}. Show which control Lyapunov function I chose \cite{Rusu05RobotuxLyapunov}. For a given path show the linear and angular velocities that are output by each controller. ***

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}
As shown in Chapter \ref{ch:results} the estimation and controls algorithms developed and implemented as part of this Thesis resulted in significant improvements to the existing algorithms used for small UGVs. The Kalman filter showed an $x$\% improvement over initial results and can now handle situations in which the robots drive in reverse. The model based controller was shown to drive at multiple velocities across different surfaces with no gain tuning required contrary to the original PID controller. Additionally, the model based controller exhibits smooth deceleration as it approaches waypoints as a consequence of the control law and not due to external commands to slow down like the PID controller. These improvements to robot navigation have been implemented in ACS and are now running on fielded systems to the benefit of end users.

There now exist better answers to the questions of "Where am I?" and "How do I get there?" due to the results obtained in theis Thesis.

\chapter{State Estimation}
\label{ch:estimation}
The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC-SD) robotics group has developed the Autonomous Capabilities Suite (ACS) which incorporates many different technologies into a single software package that can be run on a wide variety of robots and is able to easily accomodate different payload and sensor suites \cite{Sights06}. One of the ACS libraries is the adaptive extended Kalman filter which is used on the EOD robots for state estimation and is the main method used for answering the question ``Where am I?''. The idea behind the Kalman filter is relatively straightforward as the robot has some basic idea of where it is in the world using its sensors but there is some uncertainty involved in that estimate due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item different measurement accuracies from the sensors,
\item multiple sensors measuring the same state,
\item imperfect models of the robot dynamics.
\end{itemize}

*** Put in a picture of the PackBot driving with one track going over two-by-fours. ***

An example is trying to determine the heading of a robot that is driving in a straight line where the left track is moving on a flat surface while the right track is moving on an uneven surface as in Figure \ref{fig:topology}. The wheel encoders measure the distance traveled by each track and will report that the right track is traveling a greater distance than the left track which could mean that (a) the robot is turning counter-clockwise or (b) the robot tracks are moving over different surface topologies. At the same time the robot will be getting measurements about its heading from both the IMU and GPS sensors where each of those sensors will have some noise as well. As long as the controller is performing adequately and the robot is indeed traveling in a straight line with a constant heading then the IMU and GPS sensor measurements would likely indicate that the robot is traveling in a straight line. The job of the Kalman filter is to determine how much to trust the IMU, GPS and wheel encoders when calculating the robot heading and to give an accurate estimate of the actual state of the robot at any given time, especially in situations like this example where there are possible conflicting measurements.

\section{State Space Models}
\label{sec:statespacemodels}
Kalman filters and modern control systems (see Chapter \ref{ch:controls}) use the idea of a multi-dimensional state space to encapsulate all of the relevant information that is known about a system. In the case of robots the dynamics are typically captured by position, orientation, linear and angular velocities, acceleration and sometimes jerk. The general equations to describe the state space of a system are

\begin{align}
\label{eq:statespace}
\begin{split}
\dot{x} &= f(x,u,t) \\
\dot{y} &= h(x,t).
\end{split}
\end{align}

The state variables are given in vector form by $x$ and the sensor measurements are contained in the vector $y$. The state space equations are a means of representing how the state of a system changes through time based on the initial state of the system and the inputs to the system which allows the trajectory (or motion through time) to be calculated using compact notation. The inputs are assumed to include any external forces applied to the system as well as actuation provided by the system itself. The function $h(x,t)$ transforms the sensor measurements into state variables which is important when the units of a sensor are not the same as the units of the state.

\subsection{System Dynamics Model}
\label{sec:dynamics}
A model of the system dynamics is necessary in order to propagate the state of the system forward in time in the absence of measurements. It is impossible to create a perfect model of the system and even a nearly perfect model of the system will likely be too complex to compute fast enough for it to be useful. The best result that is typically available is a model with a large amount of assumptions where the most important aspects of the dynamics are captured in the model.

For the robots used in these experiments the state vector used follows that found in \cite{Kelly_1994_338}, \cite{Kelly_1994_333} where the state variables are

\begin{align*}
x_k = \left[\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c} x & y & z & V & \theta & \phi & \psi & \omega \end{array}\right]^T.
\end{align*}
In this vector $x$, $y$ and $z$ are positions, $V$ is linear velocity, $\theta$, $\phi$ and $\psi$ are Euler angles for pitch, roll and yaw, and $\omega$ is angular velocity as shown in Figure \ref{fig:robotaxes}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

    \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{images/packbotaxes}
    \caption{PackBot used in experiments with axes for position and orientation shown.}
    \label{fig:robotaxes}
\end{figure}

The nonlinear state equations to model the dynamics are

\begin{align}
\label{eq:kfnonlineardynamics}
\begin{split}
x_{k+1} &= \cos(\psi_k)*\cos(\theta_k)*V_k - V_k*\cos(\psi_k)*\sin(\theta_k)*\theta_k \\
&\qquad- V_k*\sin(\psi_k)*\cos(\theta_k)*\psi_k \\
y_{k+1} &= \sin(\psi_k)*\cos(\theta_k)*V_k - V_k*\sin(\psi_k)*\sin(\theta_k)*\theta_k \\
&\qquad+ V_k*\cos(\psi_k)*\cos(\theta_k)*\psi_k \\
z_{k+1} &= -\sin(\theta_k)*V_k - V_k*\cos(\theta_k)*\theta_k \\
V_{k+1} &= 0 \\
\theta_{k+1} &= -\omega_k *\cos(\phi_k)*\phi_k - \sin(\phi_k)*\omega_k \\
\phi_{k+1} &= \omega_k *\cos(\phi_k)/\cos^2(\theta_k)*\theta_k + \omega_k *\tan(\theta_k)*\sin(\phi_k)*\phi_k \\
&\qquad+ \tan(\theta_k)*\cos(\phi_k)*\omega_k \\
\psi_{k+1} &= \omega_k *\sin(\theta_k)*\cos(\phi_k)/\cos^2(\theta_k)*\theta_k - \omega_k *\sin(\phi_k)/\cos(\theta_k)*\phi_k \\
&\qquad+ \cos(\phi_k)/\cos(\theta_k)*\omega_k \\
\omega_{k+1} &= 0.
\end{split}
\end{align}

\section{The Kalman Filter}
\label{sec:kalmanfilter}
The ACS Kalman filter is typical of all Kalman filters in that it consists of a prediction update step and a measurement update step where the prediction update is run as fast as possible and the measurement update is run whenever new sensor data becomes available as in Figure \ref{fig:kf}. The prediction update step uses a model of the system dynamics and a measurement of elapsed time to determine where the system is in the world and will inevitably have errors due to effects that are not captured by the model. This is especially true when the system dynamics are linearized as this introduces large asssumptions about the system model that are definitely not true but can often times be close enough to reality to justify the use of these simpler equations and the inherent gains in computational time that are presented *** Clean this up ***. The measurement update step is basically a feedback step to help correct for errors in the system model using sensors to provide current data \cite{Kelly_1994_338}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{images/kf}
	\caption{The Kalman filter algorithm.}
	\label{fig:kf}
\end{figure}

The Kalman filters that run on the small UGVs used in these experiments run on digital computers and are necessarily discretized forms because of the nature of computers. From \cite{Kelly_1994_338}, \cite{Simon06OptimalEstimation} the discretized versions of (\ref{eq:statespace}) mean that the state space equations are

\begin{align}
\label{eq:kfstatemodel}
\begin{split}
x_{k+1} &= F_kx_k + \Gamma_kw_k \\
y_k &= H_kx_k + v_k
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $F_k$ is the state transition matrix relating the state at time $k+1$ to time $k$ in the absence of inputs or noise and models the steady-state system dynamics, $\Gamma_k$ is the noise distribution matrix which translates the input vector $w_k$ into the coordinates of the state vector, $H_k$ is the measurement matrix which relates the measurements to the state vector and $v_k$ is the sensor measurement noise. Note that all inputs are considered disturbances to the steady-state dynamics so $w_k$ includes noise, modeling errors, external forces and actuator forces.

The prediction update step marches the system dynamics forward in time using the equations

\begin{align}
\label{eq:kfpredictionupdate}
\begin{split}
\hat{x}_{k+1}^- &= \Phi_k\hat{x}_k^+ \\
P_{k+1}^- &= F_kP_k^+F_k^T + \Gamma_kQ_k\Gamma_k^T
\end{split}
\end{align}
and the measurement update step provides feedback from sensor data using the equations

\begin{align}
\label{eq:kfmeasurementupdate}
\begin{split}
K_k &= P_k^-H_k^T\left[H_kP_k^-H_k^T + R_k\right]^{-1} \\
\hat{x}_k^+ &= \hat{x}_k^- + K_k\left[y_k - H_k\hat{x}_k^-\right] \\
P_k^+ &= \left[I - K_kH_k\right]P_k^-.
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $P_k$ is the state covariance matrix, $K_k$ is the Kalman gain, $Q_k$ is the process covariance matrix giving a measure of the expected noise in the system model and $R_k$ is the measurement covariance matrix giving the expected noise of the sensors. The prediction update step relies on knowing $\Phi_k$, $\Gamma_k$ and $Q_k$. The measurement update step needs to know $H_k$ and $R_k$. Using (\ref{eq:kfpredictionupdate}) and (\ref{eq:kfmeasurementupdate}) an estimate of the state of the robot can be obtained at any time for use by the controls algorithms or to give feedback to a human operator.

The variables $\hat{x}_k^-$ and $\hat{x}_k^+$ in (\ref{eq:kfpredictionupdate}) and (\ref{eq:kfmeasurementupdate}) refer to estimates of the state variables before and after the measurement update step in the Kalman filter, respectively.

\subsection{Extended Kalman Filter}
\label{sec:extendedkf}
The basic Kalman filter makes the assumption that both the system model contained in $F_k$ and the measurement model in $H_k$ are linear. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) allows for nonlinear models (such as that found in (\ref{eq:kfnonlineardynamics})) to be used for $F_k$, $H_k$ or both by linearizing the models around the state estimate. To linearize the models the Jacobian, or matrix of partial derivatives, is taken about the estimated state.

The nonlinear state transition matrix, based on the dynamics described in (\ref{eq:kfnonlineardynamics}), is

\begin{align}
\label{eq:kfF}
F = \left[\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c}
0 & 0 & 0 & F_{1,4} & F_{1,5} & 0 & F_{1,7} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & F_{2,4} & F_{2,5} & 0 & F_{2,7} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & F_{3,4} & F_{3,5} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & F_{5,6} & 0 & F_{5,8} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & F_{6,5} & F_{6,6} & 0 & F_{6,8} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & F_{7,5} & F_{7,6} & 0 & F_{7,8} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\end{align}
where the elements of $F$ are

\begin{align*}
\begin{split}
F_{1,4} &= \cos(\psi)*\cos(\theta),
\end{split}
\begin{split}
F_{1,5} = -V*\cos(\psi)*\sin(\theta),
\end{split} \\
\begin{split}
F_{1,7} &= -V*\sin(\psi)*\cos(\theta),
\end{split}
\begin{split}
F_{2,4} = \sin(\psi)*\cos(\theta),
\end{split} \\
\begin{split}
F_{2,5} &= -V*\sin(\psi)*\sin(\theta),
\end{split}
\begin{split}
F_{2,7} = V*\cos(\psi)*\cos(\theta),
\end{split} \\
\begin{split}
F_{3,4} &= -\sin(\theta),
\end{split}
\begin{split}
F_{3,5} = -V*\cos(\theta),
\end{split} \\
\begin{split}
F_{5,6} &= -\omega *\cos(\phi),
\end{split}
\begin{split}
F_{5,8} = -\sin(\phi),
\end{split} \\
\begin{split}
F_{6,5} &= \omega *\cos(\phi)/\cos^2(\theta),
\end{split}
\begin{split}
F_{6,6} = \omega *\tan(\theta)*\sin(\phi),
\end{split} \\
\begin{split}
F_{6,8} &= \tan(\theta)*\cos(\phi),
\end{split}
\begin{split}
F_{7,5} = \omega *\sin(\theta)*\cos(\phi)/\cos^2(\theta),
\end{split} \\
\begin{split}
F_{7,6} &= -\omega *\sin(\phi)/\cos(\theta),
\end{split}
\begin{split}
F_{7,8} = \cos(\phi)/\cos(\theta).
\end{split}
\end{align*}
To linearize the dynamics found in (\ref{eq:kfnonlineardynamics}) so that the standard Kalman filter equations can be used the derivative must be taken with respect to the state *** Explain better/more ***. This can be approximated by using a first-order Taylor series expansion of the system dynamics such that *** Give a reference for this. Say why it is valid. ***

% \begin{align}
% \label{eq:kflinearized}
% \begin{split}

% \omega_{k+1} &= \omega_k.
% \end{split}
% \end{align}
It is also useful to invoke the low dynamics assumption which says that, for the duration of a single time step, the position estimates are only influenced by the linear velocity (and not the angular velocity) of the robot while the Euler angles are only influenced by the angular velocity of the robot and allows for several terms in the state transition matrix to be set to zero. This assumption is valid when the accelerations of the robot are at or near the level of the noise associated with the sensor measuring accelerations on the robot and is consistent with the operating regime associated with the robots in these experiments. *** This is the low dynamics assumption. Talk about how the low dynamics assumption further simplifies the model from the true physics. Now we have both linearizing and low dynamics making the model simpler and faster to compute but less accurate. These are trade-offs and the learning algorithm attempts to overcome some of the trade-offs by learning a better model given the assumptions made to simplify the calculations by using post-processing. *** This results in the Jacobian of the state transition matrix $F$ (c.f. (\ref{eq:kfF})) with respect to the states and is given in matrix form by *** Re-write this sentence. ***

\begin{align*}
\Phi_k = \left[\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c}
1 & 0 & 0 & \cos(\psi)*\cos(\theta)*\Delta T & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & \sin(\psi)*\cos(\theta)*\Delta T & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\

0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \cos(\phi)*\Delta T/\cos(\theta) \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right].
\end{align*}
The process noise matrix $\Gamma$ gives a sense of what the errors in the state dynamics are expected to be and is found as *** $\Gamma$ has inputs, noise, modeling errors, ...? Say what's really in here. ***

\begin{align*}
\Gamma_k = \left[\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c}
\Gamma_{1,1} & \Gamma_{1,2} & \Gamma_{1,3} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\Gamma_{2,1} & \Gamma_{2,2} & \Gamma_{2,3} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\Gamma_{3,1} & \Gamma_{3,2} & \Gamma_{3,3} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cos(\phi) & 0 & \sin(\phi) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\tan(\theta)*\sin(\phi) & 1 & \tan(\theta)*\cos(\phi) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\sin(\phi) / \cos(\theta) & 0 & \cos(\phi)/\cos(\theta) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\end{align*}
where the elements of $\Gamma$ are

\begin{align*}
\Gamma_{1,1} &= \sin(\psi)*\cos(\phi)-\cos(\psi)\sin(\theta)*\sin(\phi) \\
\Gamma_{1,2} &= \cos(\psi)*\cos(\theta) \\
\Gamma_{1,3} &= \sin(\psi)*\sin(\phi)+\cos(\psi)*\sin(\theta)*\cos(\phi) \\
\Gamma_{2,1} &= -\cos(\psi)*\cos(\phi)-\sin(\psi)\sin(\theta)*\sin(\phi) \\
\Gamma_{2,2} &= \sin(\psi)*\cos(\theta) \\
\Gamma_{2,3} &= -\cos(\psi)*\sin(\phi)-\sin(\psi)*\sin(\theta)*\cos(\phi) \\
\Gamma_{3,1} &= -\cos(\theta)*\sin(\phi) \\
\Gamma_{3,2} &= -\sin(\theta) \\
\Gamma_{3,3} &= \cos(\theta)*\cos(\phi).
\end{align*}
This gives expressions use to calculate all of the dynamics for the state of the robots.

\subsection{Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter}
\label{sec:adaptiveekf}
*** Discuss why $Q$ and $R$ are important and what function they serve in the Kalman filter. Why is it valid to update $Q$ and $R$ this way? Talk about how the updates are turned off when the velocity is zero, otherwise $Q$ and $R$ are adapted to a static, not dynamic, state. Similarly, talk about how this method doesn't work as well as would be hoped because the original application was for tracking satellites with low dynamics and robots have high dynamics, especially when navigating around obstacles. Also, look at the extra stuff that Busse says he had to do to get this algorithm to work in practice. I say high dynamics here, but what about the low dynamics assumption? Low is relative to sensor noise and satellites have much higher quality sensors so the noise level is much lower in addition to the actual dynamics being lower. ***

Attempting to determine the proper values for the covariance matrices $Q$ in (\ref{eq:kfpredictionupdate}) and $R$ in (\ref{eq:kfmeasurementupdate}) can be a laborious process and is often considered more of an art than a science with engineer experience being a critical factor. The ACS Kalman filter has been implemented with an adaptive scheme to update the covariance matrices in real time as the robot moves around and sensor measurements are taken into account to help overcome the time intensive nature of determining these matrices and add a degree of robustness to the state estimate \cite{Sights06}, \cite{Mehra72}, \cite{Busse03adaptiveEKF}. Estimates of $Q$ and $R$ are updated at alternating time steps in the EKF. Recall from (\ref{eq:kfpredictionupdate}) and (\ref{eq:kfmeasurementupdate}) that $\hat{x}_k^+$ and $P_k^+$ are known after the measurement update step and $\hat{x}_k^-$ and $P_k^-$ are known after the system update step in the Kalman filter.

As shown in \cite{Busse03adaptiveEKF} the first step is to calculate $Q^\star$ using

\begin{align*}
% \label{eq:qstar}
Q^\star = \left(\hat{x}_k^+-\hat{x}_k^-\right)\left(\hat{x}_k^+-\hat{x}_k^-\right)^T + P_k^- - P_k^+ - \hat{Q}_k^-.
\end{align*}
Then the estimate of $Q$ is updated such that

\begin{align}
\label{eq:qadapt}
\hat{Q}_k^+ = \hat{Q}_k^- + \frac{1}{L_Q}\left(Q^\star-\hat{Q}_k^-\right).
\end{align}

Next $R^\star$ is calculated using

\begin{align*}
% \label{eq:rstar}
R^\star = \left(y_k-\hat{y}_k^+\right)\left(y_k-\hat{y}_k^+\right)^T - H_kP_k^+H_k^T
\end{align*}
where $y_k$ are actual measurement data and $\hat{y}_k^+ = h_k\hat{x}_k^+$ is calculated after the measurement update step. Then the estimate of $R$ is updated such that

\begin{align}
\label{eq:radapt}
\hat{R}_k^+ = \hat{R}_k^- + \frac{1}{L_R}\left(R^\star-\hat{R}_k^-\right).
\end{align}

It can be seen that the estimates of both covariance matrices employ a running average algorithm and vary the weight of recent measurements and state updates via the adaptation coefficients $L_Q$ and $L_R$. *** Give example here? Explain more? Maybe, but only if I really start to compare it to the learned parameters and want to give a sense of what the differences are between the two methods. ***

\section{Establishing Ground Truth}
\label{sec:groundtruth}
Quantitatively evaluating the performance of Kalman filters can be accomplished in several ways, the best of which is to analyze the output of the Kalman filter against ground truth. Although it is nearly impossible to establish ground truth over a large area in practice the closer the measurements are to an absolute position in the world the better. To determine ground truth for the robots in these experiments a differential GPS (DGPS) system was created independently of the sensors on the robot so that very accurate measurements of the robots actual position could be logged and then used in a post-processing step to determine how well the Kalman filter estimate corresponds to ground truth.

The DGPS system consists of a GPS receiver and serial radio that make up the base station and a GPS receiver, serial radio and small computer that make up the roaming station as in Figure \ref{fig:dgps}. The GPS receivers are both Novatel receivers using the Real Time Kinematics algorithm. The base station is located in a static position and is configured to use a fixed position which is compared to what the current position would be if it were not fixed. The difference between the fixed position and the calculated position are used to generate corrections that would put the position of the GPS antenna at the fixed position and those corrections are sent to and applied at the roaming station resulting in a standard deviation of $2$ $cm$ for the position output of the roaming station. The errors are due to the effects of the GPS signal passing through the atmosphere from the satellites to the antenna as well as to multipath effects closer to the ground. The DGPS corrections are used for each satellite that the ground station and the roaming station share in the constellation of satellites they are using in their solution of a position estimate. The DGPS system is bootstrapped to the robot during testing runs to log data at a rate of $20$ $Hz$ and is only used as a tool to improve Kalman filter performance and is not meant to be used during normal operation. The C code used to setup and log data from the DGPS system is shown in Listing \ref{sec:dgpscode} of Appendix \ref{ch:code}. The same code is used for both the base station and the roaming station and changes modes based on a configuration file variable.

With a highly accurate estimate of ground truth established it becomes possible to not only study the performance of the Kalman filter but to also begin determining whether to focus efforts in improving the autonomous navigation behaviors of the robots via the estimation or controls algorithms.

\section{Discriminative Training of Kalman Filter Parameters}
\label{sec:trainingkfparams}
*** Investigate the difference between adaptive filtering and training. It seems like they accomplish the same thing, namely, convergence to some values for the covariance matrices. Do they use the same metrics? Do they converge to the same covariance matrices? Is it just online vs. offline training? Would a neural network be a good candidate for finding $Q$ and $R$ as well? All of these methods seem to be curve fitting in the multi-dimensional state space. Look at \S3.3 of \cite{Simon06OptimalEstimation} for details on how measurements affect state estimate via recursive least squares. I might also use \cite{Orderud05}. ***

\cite{Abbeel-RSS-05} describes a method to automatically learn what the covariance matrices $Q$ and $R$ should be that is an alternative, offline approach to the adaptive EKF from \S\ref{sec:adaptiveekf}. However, when used in conjunction with the adaptive EKF scheme this could allow for faster convergence times when the robots are started and for smaller ranges for the adaptation coefficients $L_Q$ and $L_R$ in (\ref{eq:qadapt}) and (\ref{eq:radapt}). This method takes advantage of ground truth measurements obtained using a DGPS system like that described in \S\ref{sec:groundtruth}. Note that in the following expressions the term $h(\mu_t)$ is the position output by the Kalman filter so that the goal is to find values of $Q$ and $R$ that cause the output of the Kalman filter to match ground truth as closely as possible.

The residual prediction error is used to estimate $Q$ and $R$ using

\begin{align*}
\left<R_{\text{res}},Q_{\text{res}}\right> = \argmin_{R,Q}\sum_{t=0}^T ||y_t-h(\mu_t)||_2^2.
\end{align*}
When the state covariance matrix $P$ is \textit{not} a multiple of the identity matrix $I$ then this metric is

\begin{align*}
\left<R_{\text{res}},Q_{\text{res}}\right> = \argmin_{R,Q}\sum_{t=0}^T (y_t-h(\mu_t))^TP^{-1}(y_t-h(\mu_t)).
\end{align*}
The error metric used for the residual prediction error method is

\begin{align}
\label{eq:kftrainingres}
e = \left(\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T ||h(\mu_t)-y_t||^2\right)^{1/2}.
\end{align}

The prediction likelihood method use the metric

\begin{align*}
\left<R_{\text{pred}},Q_{\text{pred}}\right> = \argmax_{R,Q}\sum_{t=0}^T -\log|2\pi\Omega_t| - (y_t-h(\mu_t))^T\Omega_t^{-1}(y_t-h(\mu_t))
\end{align*}
where $\Omega = H_t\Sigma_tH_t^T+P$. The error metric used for the prediction likelihood method is

\begin{align}
\label{eq:kftrainingpred}
e = -\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \left(\log|2\pi\Omega_t| - (y_t-h(\mu_t))^T\Omega_t^{-1}(y_t-h(\mu_t))\right)
\end{align}
where $\Omega$ is the same as in the above description.

A program was written to implement these algorithms and can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:qrcode}, Listing \ref{code/qr/qr.cc}. The major idea is to use logged data -- both from the output of the Kalman filter running on the robot and ground truth as recorded from the DGPS system -- and try all the possible combinations of $Q$ and $R$ matrices until the metrics identified in (\ref{eq:kftrainingres}) and (\ref{eq:kftrainingpred}) are minimized or maximized to within some convergence criterion. The possible $Q$ and $R$ matrices start with a coarse grid and are reduced to a finer grid at each iteration where the grid is centered around the best estimate found from the previous grid.

*** Show a picture of how the grid search through the parameter space works and talk about some of the shortcomings, especially in regards to getting stuck in local minima. Then, the Future Work chapter can talk about possible alternatives to this grid search algorithm. ***

\subsection{Numerical Analysis of Training Program}
\label{sec:trainingNumericalAnalysis}
The program in Listing \ref{code/qr/qr.cc} of Appendix \ref{sec:qrcode} is a brute-force grid-based approach to finding the optimal $Q$ and $R$ matrices for the Kalman filter. The number of matrices attempted can grow to a very large number when all elements of the matrices are varied so an optional algorithm was developed that trains using only diagonal $Q$ and $R$ matrices. This is not an unreasonable restriction as the original $Q$ and $R$ matrices found by hand-tuning or from the output of the adaptive Kalman filter from \S\ref{sec:adaptiveekf} used only diagonal $Q$ and $R$ matrices. The number of possible matrices that are used during training is a function of the number of states used in the Kalman filter and the number of measurements where

\begin{align}
\label{eq:trainingFullMatrices}
\begin{split}
n_Q &= 3^{n_{states}^2} \\
n_R &= 3^{n_{measurements}^2} \\
% n_Q &= 2^{n_{states}^2} \\
% n_R &= 2^{n_{measurements}^2} \\
n_{full} &= n_Q \times n_R
\end{split}
\end{align}
for varying all elements of $Q$ and $R$ and

\begin{align}
\label{eq:trainingDiagonalMatrices}
\begin{split}
% n_Q &= 2^{n_{states}} \\
% n_R &= 2^{n_{measurements}} \\
n_Q &= 3^{n_{states}} \\
n_R &= 3^{n_{measurements}} \\
n_{diagonal} &= n_Q \times n_R
\end{split}
\end{align}
for varying only the diagonal elements of $Q$ and $R$. During the experiments conducted the number of states is $8$ and the number of measurements is $5$ which gives

\begin{align*}
\begin{split}
% n_Q &= 2^{8^2} = 18446744073709551616 \\
% n_R &= 2^{5^2} = 33554432 \\
n_Q &= 3^{8^2} = 3433683820292512484657849089281 \\
n_R &= 3^{5^2} = 847288609443 \\
n_{full} &= n_Q \times n_R \\
% &= 618970019642690137449562112
&= 2909321189362570808630465826492242446680483
\end{split}
\end{align*}
per grid level when varying all elements of $Q$ and $R$ and

\begin{align*}
\begin{split}
% n_Q &= 2^8 = 256 \\
% n_R &= 2^5 = 25 \\
n_Q &= 3^8 = 6561 \\
n_R &= 3^5 = 243 \\
% n_{diagonal} &= n_Q \times n_R = 6400
n_{diagonal} &= n_Q \times n_R = 1594323
\end{split}
\end{align*}
per grid level when varying only the diagonal elements of $Q$ and $R$. The ratio is

\begin{align}
\label{eq:trainingRatio}
\begin{split}
r &= \frac{n_{full}}{n_{diagonal}} \\
% &= \frac{2^{n_{states}^2} \times 2^{n_{measurements}^2}}{2^{n_{states}} \times 2^{n_{measurements}}} \\
% &= 2^{n_{states}} \times 2^{n_{measurements}} \\
% &= 2^8 \times 2^5 = 8192
&= \frac{3^{n_{states}^2} \times 3^{n_{measurements}^2}}{3^{n_{states}} \times 3^{n_{measurements}}} \\
&= 3^{n_{states}} \times 3^{n_{measurements}} \\
&= 3^8 \times 3^5 = 1594323
\end{split}
\end{align}
which means that it will take $1,594,323$ times longer to run the training program varying all of the matrix elements compared to only varying the diagonal elements. This can make the difference between finding optimal $Q$ and $R$ matrices and not finding them with the amount of states and measurements used in these experiments.

\chapter{Controls}
\label{ch:controls}
Control systems are responsible for computing the commands necessary for actuators to cause the trajectory of a system to go from its current state to a desired state. There are many different methods that can be used to determine the output commands. One of the more popular and widely implemented control systems is the PID (Proportional, Integral, Differential) controller. Lyapunov controllers utilize knowledge of the system dynamics to compute appropriate output commands. The robots in these experiments originally used PID controllers for position and heading control and were later tested with a Lyapunov contoller.

\section{PID}
\label{sec:pid}
PID controllers use the current state estimate to determine the errors between the desired state and the current state. The goal of the PID controller is to drive those errors to zero based on a number of criterion including rise time, settling time, steady state error and overshoot (see Figure \ref{fig:pid}).

\begin{figure}[ht!]

	\includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{images/pid}
	\caption{PID controller output. The green line is the ideal output while the blue and purple lines are typical results. The orange line shows what happens when a system becomes unstable. Point $m$ represents the desired state, $m-n$ represents steady state error, point $a$ is the rise time for the blue line and point $b$ is the settling time for the blue line.}
	\label{fig:pid}
\end{figure}

There are separate PID controllers used for each of $x$ position, $y$ position and robot heading ($\psi$). The process used to compute an output using a PID controller uses three separate errors and a gain for each of those errors. Looking at the PID controller for heading the errors are
\begin{align*}
%\label{eq:piderrors}
\begin{split}
E_P &= \psi_{\text{ref}_k} - \psi_k \\
E_I &= \sum_{i=0}^{k}E_{P_i}*\Delta_T \\
E_D &= \frac{\psi_k - \psi_{k-1}}{\Delta_T}
\end{split}
\end{align*}
where $\psi_{\text{ref}_k}$ is the desired heading at the current time, $\psi_k$ is the current heading estimate, $\psi_{k-1}$ is the previous heading estimate and $\Delta_T$ is the time elapsed since the last PID control calculation was performed. The contribution of each error is then weighted by a gain to obtain the final output command, $u$, such that
\begin{align*}
%\label{eq:pidcommand}
u = K_P*E_P + K_I*E_I + K_D*E_D
\end{align*}
where $K_P$ is the proportional gain, $K_I$ is the integral gain and $K_D$ is the differential gain.

The only parameters available to tune PID controllers for performance are the gains. There are some rules of thumb for tuning gains properly as described in \cite{ZeiglerNichols42} that can work as a good starting point, along with a basic knowledge of what the effects are of modifying the different gains as summarized in Table \ref{tab:PIDGainEffects}. The difficulty in using PID controllers for the small robots used in these experiments is that the gains must be tuned for specific operating scenarios so that a set of gains that work well at full speed on asphalt do not work at all when the robot is driving in soft sand at any velocity. PID controllers work best when they only have to reject a small range of disturbances and the small robots are required to be operated in environments with a large range of disturbances.

When the characteristics of a robot are changed the PID gains must also be modified to reflect those changes. These characteristics include mass, center of mass, particular treads or motors and payloads, as these all affect the dynamics of the system. Gain scheduling is the process of tuning a system to use a different set of gains based on the operating environment or characteristics of the robot, however this is very time consuming. This motivates the search for a better control system for these small robots.

Table \ref{tab:PIDGainEffects} shows how increasing the different gain values affects the performance of the controller output in terms of rise time, overshoot, settling time and steady state error. It can be seen that a large amount of coupling exists between the gains and attempting to fix one aspect of the controller output can have unintended consequences that cause other aspects of controller output to perform suboptimally. This is in contrast to the gains that arise for Lyapunov controllers as seen in section \ref{sec:lyapunovTrajectoryConvergence}.

\section{Lyapunov Controller}
\label{sec:lyapunov}
An alternative control method do using classical PID controllers is to use model based controllers based on control Lyapunov functions. An intuitive way to conceptualize Lyapunov controllers is by thinking of them as decreasing the overall energy of a system, even when the variables involved in the functions do not represent energy \cite{Khalil02}.

The theorem for Lyapunov stability states that for an equilibrium point $x=0$ and a domain $D\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ that contains $x=0$ and for which there is a function $V:D\to\mathbb{R}$ that is continuously differentiable and has the following properties 
\begin{align*}
%\label{eq:lyapunovTheorem}
\begin{split}
V(0) &= 0 \\
V(x) &> 0 \in D-\{0\} \\
\dot{V}(x) &\leq 0 \in D-\{0\}
\end{split}
\end{align*}
then the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable. Additionally, if
\begin{align*}
%\label{eq:lyapunovAsymptoticStability}
\dot{V}(x) < 0 \in D - \{0\}
\end{align*}
then $x=0$ is asymptotically stable.

It is not always possible to find such a Lyapunov function $V$ but when one is found then this theorem holds and the "energy" of the system will always be positive and decreasing. The "energy" can consist of any variables that make $V(0) = 0$ and $V(x) > 0$ and often consist of a combination of the errors that are to be minimized in a system raised to an even power to make them positive. In that case the errors are always decreasing since $\dot{V}(x) < 0$ and the system will reach the desired state.

\subsection{Unicycle-like Robot Kinematics}
\label{sec:unicycleKinematics}
\cite{Rusu05RobotuxLyapunov,Aicardi_UnicycleLyapunov95} describe a method for using a Lyapunov controller for a differential drive robot, similar in nature to the small robots considered in these experiments and typically referred to as a unicycle-like robots in the literature. This section will mostly be a restatement of their work but with more intermediate steps and a slightly different formulation included to make the derivation easier to follow than in some of the referenced papers.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{images/packbotlyapunov}
	\caption{PackBot with coordinate system for the Lyapunov controller.}
	\label{fig:pblyapunov}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pblyapunov} will be used as the basis for the equations that follow and will be explained in further detail here. Given a robot at some arbitrary initial position we want it to move to a goal position with a specific heading where the goal position is the origin of the $<g>$ coordinate system and the desired heading is along the $x$-axis of the $<g>$ coordinate system labeled $\theta^\star$. The states that define the robot's current position, heading, and linear and angular velocities are calculated using the Kalman filter of section \ref{sec:extendedkf} whereas the goal position and heading are given as inputs to the robot. Note that the linear velocity is given by $u$ and the angular velocity by $\omega$. The control system attempts to force three separate errors to zero:
\begin{itemize}
\item $e$, the magnitude of the translation error vector as measured between the current position and goal position,
\item $\theta$, the angle between the desired heading and the translational error vector $e$,
\item $\alpha$, the angle between the current heading and the translational error vector $e$.
\end{itemize}

Additional variables used to calculate the errors include
\begin{itemize}
\item $\theta^\star$, the target heading in the global coordinate system which is aligned with the $x$-axis,
\item $\beta$, the current heading of the robot in the global coordinate system,
\item $\phi$, the difference between the target heading and the current heading in the global coordinate system.
\end{itemize}

Since unicycle-like robots exhibit non-holonomic constraints (they are only able to move forwards or backwards along the direction of their current heading and are not able to perform strafing maneuvers) it is necessary to use all three errors in the control system. The errors can all be calculated using the inputs to the robot of a goal position and goal heading and the state estimate output of the Kalman filter.

A kinematic model of the robot is used to predict how the robot moves without considering the effects of the mass of the robot or outside forces (such as friction between the robot tracks and the ground) acting on the robot with
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyapunovkinematics1}
\begin{split}
\dot{x} &= u\cos(\phi) \\
\dot{y} &= u\sin(\phi) \\
\dot{\phi} &= \omega.
\end{split}
\end{align}
The expressions in (\ref{eq:lyapunovkinematics1}) are then converted to a polar coordinate representation via a coordinate transformation and give expressions for the errors that the control system is attempting to drive to zero such that
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyapunovPolar}
\begin{split}
e &= \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\
\theta &= \atanh(y,x) \\
\alpha &= \theta - \phi.
\end{split}
\end{align}
Combining (\ref{eq:lyapunovPolar}) with (\ref{eq:lyapunovkinematics1}) results in
\begin{align*}
%\label{eq:lyapunovkinematics3}
\begin{split}
\dot{e} &= -u*\cos(\theta-\phi) \\
\dot{\theta} &= u\frac{\sin\alpha}{e} \\
\dot{\phi} &= \omega.
\end{split}
\end{align*}
Finally, replacing $\alpha$ with $\theta-\phi$ results in a kinematic model of
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyapunovkinematics}
\begin{split}
\dot{e} &= -u\cos\alpha \\
\dot{\alpha} &= -\omega + u\frac{\sin\alpha}{e} \\
\dot{\theta} &= u\frac{\sin\alpha}{e}.
\end{split}
\end{align}

\subsection{Control Lyapunov Function}
\label{sec:controllyapunov}
The control Lyapunov function is selected to be positive, contain all three error states, separate the distance error from the angle errors and is given by
\begin{align*}
%\label{eq:lyapunovfunction}
V = V_1 + V_2 = \frac{1}{2}\lambda e^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha^2+h\theta^2\right)
\end{align*}
where $\lambda$ and $h$ are positive constants that can be used to tune the controller output (see section \ref{sec:lyapunovTrajectoryConvergence}). Using the kinematics equations in (\ref{eq:lyapunovkinematics}) the derivative of each term of the candidate control Lyapunov function can be found as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Vderivatives}
\begin{split}
\dot{V}_1 &= \lambda e\dot{e} = \lambda e (-u\cos\alpha) = -\lambda eu\cos\alpha \\
\dot{V}_2 &= \alpha\dot{\alpha}+h\theta\dot{\theta} \\
&= -\alpha\omega + \alpha u\frac{\sin\alpha}{e} + h\theta u\frac{\sin\alpha}{e} \\
&= \alpha\left(-\omega + u\frac{\sin\alpha}{e} + h\theta u\frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{\sin\alpha}{e}\right) \\
&= \alpha\left(-\omega + u\frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\frac{(\alpha+h\theta)}{e}\right)
\end{split}
\end{align}
and from (\ref{eq:Vderivatives}) the total derivative is found as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyapunovfunctionderivative}
\begin{split}
\dot{V} &= \dot{V}_1 + \dot{V}_2 = -\lambda e u\cos\alpha + \alpha\left(-\omega+u\frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\frac{(\alpha+h\theta)}{e}\right).
\end{split}
\end{align}

Now it needs to be shown that $\dot{V}\leq0$ which can be done by showing that $\dot{V}_1\leq0$ and $\dot{V}_2\leq0$. This is true for $\dot{V}_1$ if $u$ takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyapunovu}
u = \gamma e\cos\alpha
\end{align}
where $\gamma$ is a positive constant different from $\lambda$. Substituting this value of $u$ into (\ref{eq:Vderivatives}) results in
\begin{align}
\label{eq:V1dotfinal}
\dot{V}_1 = -\lambda eu\cos\alpha = -\lambda\gamma e^2\cos^2\alpha \leq 0.
\end{align}
Since $V_1>0$ and $\dot{V}_1<0$ except when $e=0$ we have that $V_1$ converges asymptotically to a positive defined limit.

Replacing $u$ in the expression for $\dot{V}_2$ in (\ref{eq:Vderivatives}) results in
\begin{align}
\label{eq:V2dotreplaceu}
\begin{split}
\dot{V}_2 &= \alpha\left(-\omega+u\frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\frac{(\alpha+h\theta)}{e}\right) \\
&= \alpha\left(-\omega+\gamma e\frac{\cos\alpha\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\frac{(\alpha+h\theta)}{e}\right) \\
&= \alpha\left(-\omega+\gamma(\alpha+h\theta)\frac{\cos\alpha\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\right).
\end{split}
\end{align}

Similarly, $\dot{V}_2$ is negative if $\omega$ takes the form
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyapunovomega}
\begin{split}
\omega &= k\alpha + \gamma\frac{\cos\alpha\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\left(\alpha+h\theta\right)
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $k$ is a positive constant. Substituting this value of $\omega$ into (\ref{eq:V2dotreplaceu}) gives
\begin{align}
\label{eq:V2dotfinal}
\begin{split}
\dot{V}_2 &= \alpha\left(-k\alpha-\gamma\frac{\cos\alpha\sin\alpha}{\alpha}(\alpha+h\theta) + \gamma\frac{\cos\alpha\sin\alpha}{\alpha}(\alpha+h\theta)\right) \\
&= -k\alpha^2 \leq 0.
\end{split}
\end{align}
and $V_2$ converges asymptotically to a positive defined limit.

Substituting $\dot{V}_1$ from (\ref{eq:V1dotfinal}) and $\dot{V}_2$ from (\ref{eq:V2dotfinal}) into the expression for $\dot{V}$ (\ref{eq:lyapunovfunctionderivative}) yields
\begin{align*}
%\label{eq:Vfinal}
\dot{V} = \dot{V}_1 + \dot{V}_2 = -\lambda\gamma e^2\cos^2\alpha - k\alpha^2 \leq 0.
\end{align*}
This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\alpha=0$ \textit{and} $e=0$, which only occurs when the robot has reached its goal pose. Therefore, at any point along the robots trajectory other than the goal point this function is negative definite and is asymptotically stable.

Using the expressions for $u$ in (\ref{eq:lyapunovu}) and $\omega$ in (\ref{eq:lyapunovomega}) and substituting those values back into the kinematic model from (\ref{eq:lyapunovkinematics}) gives
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyapunovfinalkinematics}
\begin{split}
\dot{e} &= -u\cos\alpha = -\gamma e\cos^2\alpha \\
\dot{\alpha} &= -\omega + u\frac{\sin\alpha}{e} \\
&= -(k\alpha+\gamma\frac{\cos\alpha\sin\alpha}{\alpha}(\alpha+h\theta))+\gamma e\cos\alpha\frac{\sin\alpha}{e} \\
&= -k\alpha-\gamma\cos\alpha\sin\alpha+\gamma\cos\alpha\sin\alpha-\gamma h\theta\frac{\cos\alpha\sin\alpha}{\alpha} \\
&= -\left(k\alpha + \gamma h\theta\frac{\cos\alpha\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\right) \\
\dot{\theta} &= u\frac{\sin\alpha}{e} = \gamma e\cos\alpha\frac{\sin\alpha}{e} = \gamma\cos\alpha\sin\alpha
\end{split}
\end{align}

Combining (\ref{eq:lyapunovu}) and (\ref{eq:lyapunovomega}) gives the following control law to replace the PID controller from section \ref{sec:pid}:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyapunovControlLaw}
\begin{split}
u &= \gamma e\cos\alpha \\
\omega &= k\alpha + \gamma\frac{\cos\alpha\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\left(\alpha+h\theta\right)
\end{split}
\end{align}

\subsection{Calculating Control Law Variables}
\label{sec:lyapunovVariables}
The method used to calculate the variables needed for the control law in (\ref{eq:lyapunovControlLaw}) based on Figure \ref{fig:pblyapunov} is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $dx$ is the vertical component of the error vector $e$ since the $x-$axis is forward of the vehicle as seen in Figure \ref{fig:pblyapunov}.
\item $dy$ is the horizontal component of the error vector $e$ as seen in Figure \ref{fig:pblyapunov}.
\item $e$ can be calculated in several different ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use a path planner to set a carrot out in front of the robot on the path between the current position of the robot and the goal point. That carrot moves along to the next path segment when the robot gets close enough to the end waypoint of the current path segment if the current waypoint is not the final waypoint. This could cause $e$ to be much smaller than it actually is so $\alpha$ will be corrected sooner than it should be and an additional problem could occur if the robot tries to correct $\theta$ too early.
\item Use $\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}$ to get the distance to the end waypoint on the current path segment. This will cause the robot to slow down as it reaches every waypoint, even intermediate ones. Conversely, if $e$ is very large then $u$ could grow to be too large as well and necessitate the use of a limiting value for $u$.
\item Combine the two methods and use the actual distance to the end waypoint of the current path segment until that value is less than the distance to the carrot and then use the carrot distance for $e$.
\end{itemize}
\item $\psi$ is the current heading of the robot in the world coordinate frame and is calculated in the Kalman filter code based on the results from Chapter \ref{ch:estimation}.
\item $\alpha$ is the angle between the current heading of the robot $\psi$ and the error vector $e$ where the angle of the error vector $e$ is from the current position to the waypoint and found as $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)$. The desired angle error is $\alpha = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right) - \psi$.
\item $\theta^\star$ is the desired heading in the global coordinate system and there are multiple ways that it \textit{could} be set.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\theta^\star=0$ sets the desired heading as North and $\theta^\star=\pi$ sets it as South.
\item $\theta^\star=\psi$ would make the desired heading be the same as whatever the current heading happens to be.
\item $\theta^\star$ can be sent in as an additional parameter of a waypoint, say from MOCU via JAUS.
\item Look at the current waypoint and next waypoint positions. If there is no next waypoint then just go straight to the current waypoint with $\theta^\star=\psi$. If there is a next waypoint then $\theta^\star$ could be the angle from the current waypoint to the next waypoint or splitting the difference between heading to the current and next waypoints.
\end{itemize}
\item $\phi=\theta^\star-\psi$.
\item $\theta=\alpha + \phi$.
\end{enumerate}
Note that all of the angle variables need to be normalized so that they are in the range $(-\pi,\pi]$.

\subsection{Convergence of Resulting Trajectory}
\label{sec:lyapunovTrajectoryConvergence}
The gains used in the control law (\ref{eq:lyapunovControlLaw}) were selected to limit the maximum linear velocity of the robot while simultaneously establishing exponentially stable convergence towards the null value of the errors \cite{Aicardi94}. This was done using the kinematics equations from (\ref{eq:lyapunovfinalkinematics}) near the limiting value of $(0, 0)$ for $(\alpha, \theta)$ and writing the control law as an approximate linear system. It is helpful to note that $\alpha\to0\Rightarrow \alpha=\cos\alpha\sin\alpha=\sin\alpha$ as seen in Figure \ref{fig:plotSinCos}. When that is the case the following linear approximation holds:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyapunovLinearSystem}
\begin{split}
\left[\begin{array}{c} \dot{\alpha} \\ \dot{\theta} \end{array}\right]
&= \underbrace{\left[\begin{array}{c c} -k & -h\gamma \\ \gamma & 0 \end{array}\right]}_{A}
\left[\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ \theta \end{array}\right] \\
\dot{e} &= -\gamma e
\end{split}
\end{align}
with linear output equations
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lyapunovLinearOutput}
\begin{split}
u &= \gamma e \\
\omega &= (k+\gamma)\alpha + h\gamma\theta.
\end{split}
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{images/plotSinCos}
	\caption{Plot of $\alpha$, $\sin\alpha$, $\cos\alpha$ and $\sin\alpha*\cos\alpha$.}
	\label{fig:plotSinCos}
\end{figure}

This shows that $e$ converges at a rate of $e^{-\gamma t}$ while the angles converge at a rate of $e^{-\sigma t}$ where $-\sigma$ is the real part of the dominant pole of the system $A$ in (\ref{eq:lyapunovLinearSystem}). The local curvature of the robot trajectory is
\begin{align*}
c = \frac{\omega}{u}
\end{align*}
which leads to exponentially stable convergence if and only if $\sigma > \gamma$.

By setting $\gamma=0.3$ and the maximum lookahead distance used for the carrot in the path planner to $10m$ (see section \ref{sec:lyapunovVariables}) the maximum linear velocity will be $u=\gamma e\cos(\alpha=0) = 3m/s$ which is a reasonable value for the PackBot. Using $h=k=1.2$ in (\ref{eq:lyapunovLinearSystem}) gives eigenvalues for $A$ of
\begin{align*}
A = \left[\begin{array}{c c} -k & -h\gamma \\ \gamma & 0 \end{array}\right]
= \left[\begin{array}{c c} -1.2 & -0.36 \\ 0.3 & 0 \end{array}\right]
\Rightarrow &\lambda(A) = \begin{cases} \lambda_1  = -1.10199602 \\ \lambda_2 = -0.09800398 \end{cases}
\end{align*}
showing that $\sigma=1.1>\gamma=0.3$ and leading to exponentially stable convergence of the angles $\alpha$ and $\theta$.

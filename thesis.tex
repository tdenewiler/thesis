\documentclass[12pt,chapterheads]{ucsd}
% documentclass options: default is 11pt, oneside, final.
% fonts: 10pt, 11pt, 12pt -- are valid for UCSD dissertations.
% sides: oneside, twoside -- note that two-sided theses are not accepted by OGS
% mode: draft, final -- draft mode switches to single spacing, removes hyperlinks,
%                       and places a black box at every overfull hbox (check these before submission).
% chapterheads -- include this if you want your chapters to read:
% Chapter 1
% Title of Chapter
%
% instead of
%
% 1 Title of Chapter

\include{header}

% The title, copyright, and signature pages. Note that /makefrontmatter is commented out
% because it gives an error for some reason. It works in the template but not when it is
% split out into this other tex file. Despite giving an error the front matter does show
% up in the compiled PDF -- it's just annoying that it displays the error and then jumps
% to that line so that's why it's commented out for now.

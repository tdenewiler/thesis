%% DEDICATION
% You have three choices here:
%   1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.   Put in the text you want,
%   and you'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%   2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%   formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%   however you wish.
%
%   3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.
% \begin{dedication} % The style file will format this for you.
% To two.
% \end{dedication}

% \begin{mydedication} % You are responsible for formatting here.
%   \vspace{1in}
%   \begin{flushleft}
% 	To me.
%   \end{flushleft}
%
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{center}
% 	And you.
%   \end{center}
%
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{flushright}
% 	Which equals us.
%   \end{flushright}
% \end{mydedication}


%% EPIGRAPH
%  The same choices that applied to the dedication apply here.

% \begin{epigraph} % The style file will position the text for you.
%   \emph{A careful quotation\\
%   conveys brilliance.}\\
%   ---Smarty Pants
% \end{epigraph}

% \begin{myepigraph} % You position the text yourself.
%   \vfil
%   \begin{center}
%     {\bf Think! It ain't illegal yet.}
%
% 	\emph{---George Clinton}
%   \end{center}
% \end{myepigraph}

%  Also, a paragraph acknowledging all coauthors and publishers (if
%  you have any) is required in the acknowledgements page and as the
%  last paragraph of text at the end of each respective chapter. See
%  the OGS Formatting Manual for more information.
